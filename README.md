# Guess My Number

# Project Description
"Guess My Number" is a simple number guessing game that I developed as part of my HTML-CSS-JavaScript learning journey. This project is from Jonas Schmedtmann's "The Complete JavaScript Course 2025: From Zero to Expert!" Udemy course and is shared here in accordance with the course's educational purposes. The original content and teaching materials belong to Jonas Schmedtmann.

# Game Rules
The computer selects a random number between 1-20
The player tries to guess the correct number
Each wrong guess decreases your score (starting at 20 points)
If your guess is too high or too low, the game gives you a hint
When you guess the right number, the background turns green and your high score is recorded
You can restart the game using the "Again!" button
